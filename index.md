### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 part 2, This lab was one of my favorite labs for sure. During this lab I really started to understand coding. I needed to create a secret number and allow player 2 to have two guesses to guess that number. I think I had the most fun doing this lab.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 2, In this lab we created a functional game of blackjack. It incorporates the basic rules of the game blackjack. I really like the game black jack, however we had a big problem. We needed the ace card to count as one point but only when there is another ace. We had so much trouble finding a solution but we persevered and completed the lab.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 part 1, We thought that both parts of this lab in general were really cool. I am into animation and in this lab we created a little animation between different colors. This lab was very difficult for us to complete however we got stuck on so many parts. Still it helped us improve our skills and allowed us to see what coding could accomplish.
